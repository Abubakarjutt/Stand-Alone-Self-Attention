  - Awesome :)

## Method
  1. Replacing Spatial Convolutions
  2. Replacing the Convolutional Stem
  3. Attention Stem

## Experiments
### Setup
  - Spatial extent: 7
  - Attention heads: 8
  - Layers:
    - ResNet 26: [1, 2, 4, 1]
    - ResNet 38: [2, 3, 5, 2]
    - ResNet 50: [3, 4, 6, 3]

  
## Requirements
